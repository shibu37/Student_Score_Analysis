# **Student Scores Data Analysis Project**

This project is a data analysis of student scores using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The analysis explores various factors affecting students' performance across different subjects, such as math, reading, and writing. The dataset contains demographic information and other relevant variables such as parental education, weekly study hours, and ethnic groups. 

### **Project Overview**
The goal of this analysis is to discover patterns and relationships between students' performance and various demographic as well as lifestyle factors, such as:
- Gender distribution
- Parents' education and marital status
- Ethnic group distributions
- Weekly study hours
- Test preparation and sports practice

### **Technologies Used**
- **Languages/Tools**: Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

### **Dataset**
The dataset contains several columns, including:
- `Gender`
- `ParentEduc` (Parent's Education)
- `ParentMaritalStatus`
- `MathScore`, `ReadingScore`, `WritingScore`
- `WklyStudyHours`
- `EthnicGroup`
- `TestPrep`, `PracticeSport`

### **Key Insights**
1. **Gender Distribution**: The dataset revealed that female students were more represented than male students.
   
2. **Parent's Education Impact**: There is a positive correlation between the education level of the parents and the students' performance in all three subjects (Math, Reading, and Writing).

3. **Parental Marital Status**: The analysis suggests varying performance trends based on the marital status of parents.

4. **Ethnic Group Distribution**: The students are distributed among five ethnic groups (A, B, C, D, and E), and the data shows the representation percentage of each group.

5. **Weekly Study Hours**: A boxplot analysis was used to observe the variation of Math, Reading, and Writing scores based on students' weekly study hours.

6. **Test Preparation & Sports Practice**: Test preparation and sports practice also show trends in how students perform in different subjects, revealing interesting correlations between academic and extracurricular activities.

### **Visualizations**
The project contains several visualizations to illustrate these insights, including:
- Gender distribution count plot
- Heatmaps to show the relationship between parental factors and student performance
- Boxplots for the weekly study hours against scores
- Pie charts for ethnic group distribution
- Bar plots for test preparation and sports practice versus scores


### **Conclusion**
This analysis provides valuable insights into how different personal and demographic factors influence student performance. It can be useful for educators, policymakers, and parents who want to understand the broader patterns of academic achievement.
